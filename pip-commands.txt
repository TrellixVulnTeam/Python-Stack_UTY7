Run the following commands:

pip3 install django
pip3 uninstall django
	-
pip list - Lists pip installed packaged

deactivate (This will deactivate your virtual environment)

pip3 list (How is the result different from when you ran pip list with the virtualenv activated? Hint, you should not have as many things listed when the virtualenv is deactivated. If your results are the same, go back and figure out what went wrong.)


cd to my_environments
python3 -m venv py3Env 

source py3Env/bin/activate --- to activate



pip install Django==2.2.4 (We know you already ran this one. What information do you see returned in terminal after this command?)

pip freeze (What's the difference between freeze and list?)- outputs installed packages in requirements format

First cd into your Desktop directory (cd ~/Desktop), then run this command: pip freeze > requirements.txt. What do you see when you ls? What's inside this file?

pip uninstall Django

pip show Django

pip search Flask This one might take a moment to execute.
